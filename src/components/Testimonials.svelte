            "Great restaurant with a long history of providing our family a
            consistently excellent dining experience. The owners and staff
            always exceed our expectations and truly seem to appreciate their
            customers. There are so many great menu items to choose from. Their
            salad dressing is AMAZING! We recently celebrated Mother's Day
            there. The weather was beautiful that morning. We really enjoyed
            sitting out on the covered patio. If you've never been, you owe it
            to yourself to give them a try."

            Pork Chop with Scallion Mashed Potatoes, Balsamic Roasted Red
            Onions, and Port Reduction Sauce. It was so lovely and tender, it
            literally fell off the bone. Tuscany is an absolutely beautiful
            restaurant that I would highly recommend it for special occasions
            and events."

            my life last nightâ€¦. at your restaurant!! I have been out of town
            and I saw the email about the 3-course Bastille Day/Week dinner. It
            was a last minute thing and I love Chicken Cordon Bleu, so I decided
            to go. Anyway, I had the cold-smoked French herring with warm potato
            salad and the fruit tart. Everything was just superb!"
